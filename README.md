## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This particular project was a collaboration with [@maiaflow](https://github.com/maiaflow). We continued to learn how to do these projects together. One of the biggest things we accomplished on this project was to create the toggle interactivity using only HTML and CSS. We decided to use JS only to set the pricing changes. 

### Continued development

I am looking forward to more collaborations with [@maiaflow](https://github.com/maiaflow).

## Acknowledgments

Thank you again Maia for wanting to do these challenges in a collaboration setting. We haven't mastered how to do the work simultaneously but it is always lots of fun screen sharing through Zoom.
